# ⭐ SSM-BROWSE — Quickstart Guide  

Symbolic • Deterministic • Non-Semantic • Zero ML

---

## 1. Requirements

No installation required.

All SSM-Browse demos are fully self-contained HTML files.
Just double-click any demo to launch it in your browser.

- No Python
- No packages
- No network access
- No ML or external engines
- 100% offline and deterministic

---

## 2. Folder Structure (Core + Research Editions)

The demos and documents for SSM-Browse follow a simple, fully HTML-based structure:

/demos  
    ssm_browse_core_v1.html  
    ssm_browse_research_v2.html  
    ssm_browse_demo_v3.html  
    ssm_browse_full_v4.html  

/docs  
    Concept-Flyer_SSM-Browse_ver2.0.pdf  
    Brief_SSM-Browse_ver2.0.pdf  
    SSM-Browse_ver2.0.pdf  

All demos run directly from HTML.  
No Python is required for any edition.

Note: ssm_browse_demo_v3.html is a static illustration used to demonstrate the visual structure. It has no interactive panels.

---

## 3. Run the Mini-Browser Demo (Core / Research Editions)

Open the symbolic browser by:

- Double-clicking `ssm_browse_core_v1.html`, or  
- Right-click → Open with your browser

You will see:

- Tabs panel  
- Alignment lane (`a_lane`)  
- Quero coherence lane (`q_lane`)  
- Event log (deterministic stamps)  
- Drift matrix  
- Replay integrity  

Everything is deterministic and identical across devices.

---

## 4. Edition 3 — WebExtension Edition (Symbolic Tab Events)

This edition symbolically reflects real browser tab-level events  
without ever reading page content.

It uses:

manifest.json  
background.js  
event_capture.js  
panel.html  

Features:

- No semantic access  
- No content visibility  
- Zero ML  
- Offline symbolic envelopes  

---

## 5. Edition 4 — DevTools-Class Edition

A complete symbolic browser inspector built into a single HTML file:

- a_lane + q_lane updates  
- deterministic stamps  
- drift matrix  
- replay verification  
- reset and action controls  

Launch by double-clicking:

ssm_browse_full_v4.html

Runs offline and remains perfectly reproducible.

---

## 6. No Semantics. No Browsing. No Rendering.

SSM-Browse never accesses any real content.

It symbolically models:

tab opening  
navigation  
scroll  
idle  
alignment lane  
Quero coherence  
deterministic stamps  
drift across tabs  
replay integrity  

The result is a portable, mathematical browsing state.

## 7. Next Steps

Explore:

- richer event sequences  
- symbolic structural replay  
- multi-tab drift analysis  
- symbolic audit trails  
- reproducible navigation sequences  

SSM-Browse is a deterministic, portable framework  
for structural, non-semantic browsing.
