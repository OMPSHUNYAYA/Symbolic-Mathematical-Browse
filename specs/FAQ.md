## **SECTION A — Purpose & Philosophy**

### **A1. What is SSM-Browse?**

A miniature symbolic browser demonstrating how any interaction can be converted into:

- symbolic envelopes  
- Quero coherence lanes  
- deterministic stamps  
- drift matrices  
- replayable navigation timelines  

It never interprets content — only **structural behaviour**.

---

### **A2. Why build a symbolic browser instead of a real one?**

Because the purpose is **structural truth**, not internet browsing.

SSM-Browse shows that tabs can carry:

- deterministic, bounded posture  
- structural coherence  
- reproducible event lineage  
- drift signals  
- verifiable replay integrity  

It is a **teaching + research demonstrator**, not a replacement for browsers.

---

### **A3. Does SSM-Browse use ML, embeddings, or ranking logic?**

No.

- **Zero ML**  
- **Zero semantics**  
- **Zero inference**  
- **Zero personalization**  
- **Zero hidden logic**  

SSM-Browse is **pure symbolic mathematics**.

---

### **A4. Why is this relevant now?**

Modern applications increasingly suffer from:

- unpredictable behaviour  
- invisible decision systems  
- non-deterministic UIs  
- unreplayable user journeys  

SSM-Browse replaces all of that with **deterministic structure** and **transparent reproducibility**.

---

## **SECTION B — Architecture & Symbolic Engine**

### **B1. What is the core innovation?**

Every tab becomes a **structural object** carrying:

- `a_lane` → alignment  
- `q_lane` → coherence  
- event stamps → deterministic lineage  
- drift values → cross-tab divergence  
- optional **ZETA-0 resets**  

Built on the same mathematical foundations powering **SSM-Tweet, SSM-Clock, and SSM-DE**, under the **Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics** stack.

### **B2. What generates the lanes?**

```
a_lane, q_lane = ssm_kernel(events)
```

The kernel ensures:

- stable bounded behaviour  
- deterministic updates  
- identical replay everywhere  

---

## **B3. What counts as a tab event?**

Any symbolic action:

- open_tab  
- navigate  
- scroll  
- idle  
- (future) focus/switch  

Each event includes a type, metadata (optional), and a deterministic stamp.

---

## **B4. What is the drift matrix?**

A structural comparison across tabs:

- **0.00–0.19 → Stable**  
- **0.20–0.49 → Diverging**  
- **≥0.50 → Unstable**  

It exposes invisible structural divergence in multi-tab behaviour  
and enables verifiable drift analysis.

---

# **SECTION C — Tabs, Events, Lanes, Drift & ZETA-0**

## **C1. Why track tabs symbolically?**

The visual UI shows only appearance.  
Symbolic lanes show:

- underlying structure  
- reproducibility  
- predictable transitions  
- hidden instability  

This is extremely valuable for diagnostics, UX research, auditing, and compliance.

---

## **C2. What does the Quero lane represent?**

Quero (`q`) tracks structural coherence across interactions:

- smooth vs abrupt transitions  
- shocks or oscillations  
- irregular multi-tab rhythm  

No semantics, no behaviour analysis — **pure structure**.

---

## **C3. Why track drift?**

Drift reveals:

- diverging tab groups  
- unstable behaviour  
- inconsistent journeys  
- multi-tasking instability  

These patterns are normally invisible.

---

## **C4. What is ZETA-0 and why is it important?**

ZETA-0 is a **neutral reset event**:

```
a_lane = 0
q_lane = 0
```

Triggered when cumulative drift crosses a manifest-declared threshold.

It is:

- deterministic
- non-semantic
- transparent
- bounded
- identical across devices
- available in Research / WebExtension / DevTools editions

ZETA-0 never changes content or browsing behaviour.  
It only resets structural posture, ensuring long-term stability and replay safety.

---

## **C5. Which editions support Quero and ZETA-0?**

| Edition             | a_lane | q_lane | Drift | Replay | Stamps | ZETA-0 |
|--------------------|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Core (5 KB)        |   ✔    |   ✔    |   ✔   |   ✔    |   ✔    |   ✖    |

# **SECTION D — Replay Integrity & Determinism**

## **D1. What is replay integrity?**

A deterministic stamp sequence guaranteeing:

- unambiguous ordering  
- device-independent lineage  
- identical reconstruction  

---

## **D2. Why is replay important?**

Traditional applications cannot recreate:

- event order  
- tab state  
- structural posture  

SSM-Browse guarantees exact deterministic reconstruction.

---

## **D3. Is replay cryptographically enforced?**

Yes — using deterministic, timestamp-free hashing:

- tamper-visible  
- reproducible  
- fully offline  
- cross-device identical  

---

# **SECTION E — Design Choices & Footprint**

## **E1. Why is SSM-Browse so small (5–8 KB)?**

Because symbolic systems must be:

- portable  
- inspectable  
- timeless  
- deterministic  
- dependency-free  

All four editions remain under 5–8 KB, including full drift + replay + coherence.

---

## **E2. Why is there no animation?**

Animations introduce nondeterminism:

- timers  
- frame rates  
- jitter  

SSM-Browse prioritizes structural purity, not UX visuals.

---

## **E3. Can animations be added?**

Yes — in optional, non-authoritative editions.  
The core remains deterministic.

---

## **E4. Why is everything offline and local?**

To ensure:

- zero network dependency  
- zero privacy concerns  
- zero variability  
- perfect reproducibility  

Every user sees the same results, everywhere.

---

## **E5. Why no real browsing capability?**

Real browsing introduces:

- semantics  
- network variance  
- timing unpredictability  
- personalized behaviour  

SSM-Browse models structure only.

---

## **E6. Why no external libraries?**

External dependencies create:

- version drift  
- hidden behaviour  
- unpredictable execution  

Pure HTML + CSS + JS guarantees reproducibility.

---

## **E7. Why intentionally limit features?**

To ensure SSM-Browse remains:

- a sidecar symbolic engine  
- not a browser  
- not a UI toolkit  
- not a rendering engine  

**Purpose purity → structural clarity.**

---

# **SECTION F — Adoption, Extension & Future Versions**

## **F1. Can platforms use SSM-Browse concepts?**

Yes — immediately.

Platforms can embed symbolic:

- event logging  
- drift computation  
- coherence tracking  
- replay trails  

…into any multi-tab or multi-screen system.

---

## **F2. Can mobile apps use it?**

Yes.  
The kernel is:

- portable  
- deterministic  
- tiny  

Suitable even for low-memory devices.

---

## **F3. What future editions are possible?**

Optional, non-authoritative editions may include:

- animated structural lanes  
- symbolic journey maps  
- scrubbable timelines  
- richer DevTools overlays  
- compiled/native variants  

The HTML editions remain the authoritative source of deterministic behaviour.

---

## **F4. Are compiled or standalone versions planned?**

Only if widely requested.  
Compiled versions will always be non-authoritative mirrors, while the HTML editions remain:

- perfectly reproducible  
- cross-platform neutral  
- suitable for long-term archival  

---

## **F5. Is SSM-Browse future-proof?**

Yes — because it is:

- mathematical  
- deterministic  
- dependency-free  
- non-ML  

Symbolic states will replay identically even decades from now.
